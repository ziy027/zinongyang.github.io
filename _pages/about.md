I am currently a PhD candidate in Computational Neuroscience at Boston University and MIT, advised by [Dr. Laura D. Lewis]( https://www.lewisneurolab.org/).

I completed my BSc in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Neuroscience at UC San Diego, where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Jaime A. Pineda](https://bci.ucsd.edu/Home.html), [Dr.Timothy Brady](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/), and [Dr. Virginia de Sa](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~desa/people.html).
